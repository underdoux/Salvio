# ERP Workflow Mapping

This document describes the flow of data and processes through the Ultimate POS ERP system, highlighting key transactional pathways and integration points.

## Transactional Flow

1. **Sales Initiation**  
   Sales orders are created via the POS interface or backend, triggering inventory checks and customer account updates.

2. **Payment Processing**  
   Payments are recorded and linked to sales transactions, updating financial ledgers and customer balances.

3. **Inventory Updates**  
   Stock levels are adjusted based on sales, purchases, returns, and stock transfers.

4. **Reporting**  
   Data from sales, purchases, and inventory is aggregated to generate financial and operational reports.

## Integration Points

- Middleware manages authentication, session data, and localization.
- Controllers coordinate between UI requests and business logic.
- Services and helpers provide reusable functionality across modules.

## Visual Aids

Consider incorporating flowcharts or diagrams to illustrate these workflows for enhanced clarity.
